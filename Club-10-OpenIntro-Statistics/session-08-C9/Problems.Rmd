# Problem 9.1

a.  $weight = -8.94 smoke + 123.05$
b.  

-   The intercept is the average weight, in ounces, of a baby born to a mother that does not smoke.
-   Average weight of a baby where the mother does not smoke: 123.05 oz.
-   Average weight of a baby where the mother who smokes: `r -8.94 + 123.05` oz.
c. Yes.

# Problem 9.5
a. 
  * Recall $SE = \frac{sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
  * $\sigma =$ `r 0.12 * sqrt(55)`
  * 95th CI = (`r qnorm(c(0.05/2, 0.95 + 0.05/2), mean = -0.08, sd = 0.12)`)

b. Yes, because 0 is within the 95th CI.
