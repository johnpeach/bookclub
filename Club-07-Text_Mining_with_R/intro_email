Hello Bookclub:

I hope that you are excited about starting the Text Mining with R book club. I know that I am.

We will be using Github to share our slides and slack to communicate, plus Zoom of course.

We are asking everyone to lead a session. The idea is that you read the material carefully and prepare a 15-20-min summary and prepare an exercise. There is no expectation that you become an expert on the material. We are all here to learn together.

There are a number of things that you need to do before the first meeting. Please do the following before the first meeting:

1) Clone https://github.com/ocrug/bookclub
2) Send john@jppeach.com your GitHub account name so I can give you commit access
3) Slack signup for slack https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack-signup
4) Log in to slack https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack and join the channel #oc_rug-boockclub
5) Read chapters 1-2
6) Email john@jppeach.com what session you would like to lead. I will lead the first session, after that it is first come first served. https://www.meetup.com/OC-RUG/events/276575373/

Please do these things before the first meeting. If you have any problems, please post a question on slack, or email me.

Cheers
John
